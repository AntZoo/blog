                    I am a Russian currently living in the Czech Republic. I studied Swedish philology and although I don't use my education that much nowadays I still like learning languages, it's one of my hobbies that takes up quite a large part of my time. I work as a software developer - and that is my second hobby. I also play guitar, record podcasts and read books.
