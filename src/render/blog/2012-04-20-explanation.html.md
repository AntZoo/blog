I guess I owe you guys an explanation - the blog has changed, again. I've tried to adapt the existing rss feeds, but one of them, the Playground one, has changed to a feed that encompasses all blog posts.

The thing is, firstly, I grew tired of Tumblr. It turned out that it lacks some pretty basic features. Secondly, I only left Blogger because the new design destroyed the enclosure links feature which I liked.

Last weekend I looked at Blogger again, and saw that they had improved some small details, including returning the enclosure links. At the same moment I got this feeling I am creating too many blogs - one per language, a different one for podcasts, another one for the photos. And I don't really blog THAT much. It was time to consolidate the blogs. I saw that you can't do that in Tumblr, and that was that. The last straw. 

Now, there is only one blog: blog.zujev.eu. All other addresses will be somehow redirected to that address. The different language tags and all the different podcast posts and photo posts are now differentiated via tags (labels if you talk Blogger). Soon I'll add the pages with all the feeds and links, kill the Tumblr pages and turn them into redirects and that'll be it. In the meantime I am trying how to write a simple Blogger updater in Java to transfer all Tumblr posts here.

Stay tuned, it'll be fun.
