As you all know, I now live in a city that by Russian measures would be considered to be a smaller town. Three hundred people somehow isn’t such a breathtaking number for Russians. It is actually a bit strange, as Russian cities don’t all have millions and millions of citizens. There are only about 10 whose population is above the million milestone which isn’t that mindblowing, if you take into account the size of the country.

But anyway, that’s not the point of my story. The point being the difference of a large city from a smaller one. And I’m not even talking Russia vs. Czech Republic - more like Prague vs. Ostrava. When I was about to move here, I started studying various forums and messaging boards to see what people were writing on the topic. But the main problem with my situation was that I was going to move to Ostrava. You see, most Russians (probably abt. 95% of them (okay, I might be overestimating - more like 75-80%)) that move to the Czech Republic, move to Prague or Carlsbad. A few move to Brno, even less - to other little towns, scattered around the country. And very, very few move to Ostrava. It seems that nobody really knows about the existence of the place. But that isn’t the point either.

The point (again) is that in those discussions the immigrants’ reviews were that everything is very complicated, the immigrant police is strict and unfriendly, has absolutely no interest in helping one out and tries to hinder you on every step. So, the more I read the more terrified I was becoming. Then came the day for me to hand in the documents to receive my temporary residence permit. And everything went smooth afterwards - the police is never crowded, the workers there are always extremely polite and helpful. Nevere have they tried to get rid of me and not one of my questions has been left unanswered. So, up until now - my experience was pretty much perfect. There are the long waiting times, of course, but I don’t think anybody can get around that.

Today I went to the police again. And again - I left the building with a smile on my face and a happy feeling of having completed the task at hand without having been insulted by an ignorant and lazy worker. I was ready in 15 minutes - 8.00 I was there, 8.15 I was out. And I believe deeply that I have the size of the city to thank for this success. You see, there aren’t as many people here, as there are in Prague, the workers at various state institutions aren’t as tired of all the immigrants coming to see them, with their shady backgrounds and terrible knowledge of the Czech language. And therefore, it is a pleasure to talk to them.

The moral of the story - if you are going to move somewhere, the smaller the town, the better the experience. ;)
