I’ve just gotten an email from my health insurance provider. They sent me a paper I can print out that I can use instead of the insurance card that is yet to come to me by snail mail. The funny thing is the lady who sent me the email had this in her signature:

> Chráníme nejen zdraví, zbytečný tisk ničí lesy!

That means “We aren’t only protecting health - pointless printing destroys forests!” in Czech. Yeah, right. So they are saving the forests. The thing is she sent me a scanned paper that she first printed out. *Sure, she had to sign it and hit it with a stamp. But damn.*
