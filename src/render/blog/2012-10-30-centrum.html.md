Since the Nová Karolina shopping centre had been built, shops started leaving the historical centre of the city, leaving behind empty windows and streets. Coupled with a constant feeling that the city administration doesn't have a slightest interest in supporting the centre, it makes me wonder - what lies ahead for Ostrava? What will become of the centre. Frankly, I'm all for the idea of moving the shops out of the historical centre, but on one condition: that the centre lives as a historical monument. The government should restore the buildings, make the area safe for people, make more pedestrian-only zones and open museums, cafés and restaurants. You know the routine. But for now it seems that Ostrava centre's future is to be destroyed and that of it's historical buildings - to be replaced by offices and modern constructions. This makes me sad.
