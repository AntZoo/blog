Wow. Incredible. Today I came home and tried restoring my iPhone - I had troubles with the volume down button. I needed to finally see whether it was a software or a hardware problem (although I already knew the answer). As it turns out, it's a hardware problem. So, again: wow. I've had this phone for what, 3 years? And it's been in service 4 times. This time will be the fifth time. Jeezus! Each time - a new problem, it's as if I'm having fun going to the service every now and again.

And to top it off - my mid-2012 Macbook Air. 9 months. **9** freaking months. 80% battery health, doesn't hold as much charge as **9** months ago (and yes, I've tried to follow all Apple's guides on servicing the battery) and **dropping**. Plus the backspace button feels as if it's pressing against something and when typing quickly I press it successfully about 7 times out of 10. Which isn't how it's supposed to be.

Apple! Come on! Where's the promised quality? Where's the *premium* product I bought from you? Ugh.
