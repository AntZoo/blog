I started learning Japanese. It’s a wonderful experience that keeps me happy every day and will certainly cover the subject in the next episode of my podcast. For now I am going to give you a spoiler - there’a gonna be a new language in the Playground - 日本語. ;)

And PS: At the moment I can spell two words - ねこ and あい, meaning “cat” and “love”, respectfully. Plus 日本語, which I cheated to learn. It means “Japanese” and is written in kanji, the hardest of Japanese’s syllabaries. By the end of the week I will have learnt Hiragana. Yeah!
