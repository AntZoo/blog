description: The Good Book song by Tim Minchin
excerpt: "Tim Minchin (and Yegor Zhgun) sing and joke about religion."
---

A Russian artist famous for his caricatures, Yegor Zhgun, recently drew an animated video to accompany Tim Minchin's song "The Good Book". I found both the song and the video to be extremely funny (and offensive to religious people, so don't watch it if religious jokes offend you), so here you are, the original and the cartoon:

<div class="fotorama" data-width="100%" data-allowfullscreen="native" data-width="100%">
  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=oC-fsFT7ZKs">The Good Book (Yegor Zhgun)</a>
  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=EIBRdBVkDHQ">The Good Book</a>
</div>

And, as an added surprise, a sort of a cherry on the icing, here's a little speech about the Americans and the theory of evolution:

>... and they can just float the fuck away.
