Okaay. The news. 

We’re all sick. Petya is getting better already, but we managed to catch his cold and are now struggling with the virus ourselves. I’m tired, got a headache and can’t breathe because my nose is full of goo.

On the bright side though - I finally made myself open a book on programming and am following it to learn how to write applications. I am using the “Beginner’s guide to programming” by Apress at the moment. The ultimate goal - to work as a freelance programmer in my spare time, writing Mac and iOS software.

Also, I am now writing down my dreams. I’ve two reasons - firstly, I just want to learn to remember them better; secondly, I’d very much like to lucid dream.

Ok. My tiredness is getting worse. I’m gonna go lie down while I still got a little time.
