Finally got to my blog to write about the MiB movie I enjoyed a couple of Sundays ago. To save you the trouble of reading a long post, here’s its summary: it was great.

Ok, now that that’s out of the way, let me try to tell you some details. Oh and yeah, SPOILER ALERT. The next paragraph will be a spoiler, so skip it if you haven’t watched the movie yet.

The plot is quite known to everybody who was following the progress of the filming - there’s this bad guy, Boris the Animal, whom agent K had caught in the late sixties and stuck into a lunar jail. Boris is the last of his species, a race that strives on destruction and just annihilates every planet it sets its foot upon. Along with the planet’s inhabitants. And they hunt down the remaining inhabitants, should they escape. When K overpowered Boris, he also installed ArcNet - a shield that protects the Earth from Boris’ species. Now that Boris escaped though, the criminal has a plan - he is to return to the past to help his past self kill agent K, prevent the installation of ArcNet and begin an invasion on Earth. He succeeds in doing so, but due to the peculiarities of time travel and of the consequences of time traveling paradoxes J still remembers that K wasn’t dead yesterday, although everybody around him says he had been dead for over forty years. O helps J with the little info she can tell him and J travels in time to stop Boris and to help K survive. Naturally, he succeeds, in the end discovering something he wasn’t expecting to discover.

Right, now that we are past the spoilery part, let’s discuss the movie. Again I should warn you that there might be some spoiler-ish parts here as well. Not that much though.

You can’t overestimate the role of the director of the movie. It is Barry Sonnenfeld, the guy who made the first part o the series. That’s very fortunate and if there ever will be a MiB 4, I hope he will be the director again. The difference between part two and part three is astonishing - they are two completely different movies, part two being a cheesy comedy that isn’t even that funny and part three being a great successor to the brilliant first part. Will Smith plays the same ol’ J, adding to the character, not subtracting from it - the same attitude, the same type of jokes. Tommy Lee Jones plays the old K and he’s great too, as always. Now, the young K is played by a “new” guy, Josh Brolin. He does that very nicely, portraying the K before the incident - the more extraverted K. Still he manages to combine his own character with the traits he got from Tommy Lee Jones. Being more extraverted he still isn’t very talkative and he smiles quite similarly, although not completely the same.

Then there’s the little things, stuff that they call Easter eggs in computer apps. One of my favourites is more or less a reminiscence of a scene from the first MiB. Remember how J first got to the headquarters? K was showing him around and brought him to a wall with lots of different screens. He then explained that there they watched aliens living on the Earth under a disguise and that, e.g., Elvis Presley wasn’t dead, but just flew back to his home planet. This time J comes to work and goes by those screens. Guess whose face is there on one of them. Any ideas? Come on! All right, I’ll tell you: Lady Gaga. :) That really made me chuckle. :)

The other thing that kinda made me feel warm in the heart was that Griffin guy (creature? alien?). I really loved how they implemented that infinite possibilities idea. It makes one think again about our world, the choices we make and the consequences of those choices. And funny enough, it crosses paths with some of my dad’s and my ideas on god (I’ll lighten you up on that one once, it’ll be fun - trust me, no religious crap, pure philosophy) and free will. I absolutely loved the end scene of the film, with Griffin going all “Oh… That was close”.

And now pardon me, I think I’ll go and and re-watch the first part of the series.
