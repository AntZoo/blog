Cheetah. Puma. Jaguar. Panther. Tiger. Leopard. Snow Leopard. Lion.

Those are the code names of the last 8 Mac OS X versions. From 10.0 to 10.7. Lion is quite a choice. It could mean that version 10-point-something is now a thing of the past. What lies ahead? Most likely, 11.0. It could be a new version of the OS in many aspects, probably erasing the difference between the big system and it’s younger brother, iOS, even to a greater extent. But will it be called OS XI? I don’t know about you, but I kinda doubt it. At the last WWDC Mac OS X dropped the “Mac” part and became just OS X. It is a well (more or less) known brand. And looks a lot more beautiful, more perfect and complete than OS XI. The name is great, it is short, it is sharp, it is as perfect as the circle shape was for the Greeks. I don’t think there will ever be an OS XI. There will be OS X 11.0. And OS X 12.0. And so on. The only question is - what will be the future code names?
