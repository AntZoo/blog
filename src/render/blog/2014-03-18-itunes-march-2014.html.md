description: The latest and greatest from my iTunes shopping spree.

It's been a couple of months since I last updated you on new albums in my music library. So here's a quick list I managed to jot down to keep you informed. Almost half of the list are there because I was cleaning up my wishlist in iTunes Store, if you know what I mean. As before, the list is in no specific order.

1. [Сплин - Резонанс][splean]  
I may write a separate blog post about this album, seeing as Splean is my favourite Russian band. The quintessential idea though is that this is the good ol' Splean, the one we all know and love. The album sounds as if it were written ten years ago (not in a bad way - just feels more like the old Splean) and in the same time it is more mature, making a statement about happiness and life.
2. [Louis Armstrong - Hello Louis][louarmstrong]  
I only know a couple of songs by Louis Armstrong - like, "Hello, Dolly" and "Moonriver". Obviously, I'm joking, but that's not far from truth. Nevertheless, I like to listen to him from time to time. This album is meant to fill the gapping hole that is the absence of Armstrong's music in my medialibrary.
3. [BRAVO! - The Classical Album 2014][bravo2014]  
One of many classical music collections in my library. Nothing special.
4. [Stevie Wonder - Number Ones][steviewonder]  
As with Louis Armstrong, I only know Stevie Wonder because of "I Just Called To Say I Love You". I'm sure there's more to his music than just that and this album should introduce me to his music.
5. [Агата Кристи - Избранное][agatha]  
Agatha Christie is, again, one of those bands that I never really listened to. I probably only know their song "Опиум" and I'm not even sure that that is how it is called. Still, I always thought it'd be great to have at least a greatest hits collection. And now I do have it.
6. [Валерий Гергиев - Величайшие Произведения Русской Классики][gergiev]  
After I downloaded this album we had an interesting discussion with my wife about whether it is acceptable to say that Khachaturian is a Russian composer if he was basically an Armenian composer who just happened to live in USSR and, for the most part of his life, in Moscow. It probably isn't. But still, Gergiev is a great conductor and this cd contains tons of great (and, despite the name, only about 95% Russian) music.
7. [Morphine - Neverland][morphine]  
Absolutely unexpectedly found this band, and I even don't remember when. It was on my wishlist for quite a while and now, finally, it is in my medialibrary.
8. [Smokie - Greatest Hits Collection][smokie]  
One more band whose greatest hits I always wanted to have. And now I do.
9. [Frank Sinatra - Christmas With Sinatra and Friends][sinatra]  
This Christmas I didn't have any proper Christmas music to listen to. Now I do (sorry for repeating this phrase over and over again).
10. Песенки под ёлочку: [выпуск 1][furtree1] и [выпуск 2][furtree2]  
Again. Some music to listen to during next Christmas. I tried Spotify before and it was horrible - all that was available were some terrible disco/pop/??? records that got my ears to bleed five seconds into each and every song. Modern Russian pop. Which is synonymous with "huge pile of shit".
11. [Музыка кино: Голубой экран][soundtracks]  
Nostalgic music from Soviet movies. You can think what you want about that era, but the movies were truly great.
12. Хиты 1960-1980: [Любимые глаза][1960-hits-eyes], [Замыкая круг][1960-hits-circle], [А нам всё равно][1960-hits-zajcy] 
Again, a little bit of nostalgia. Even though it was a long time before I was born, I still know and love quite a few of these songs.
13. [Русские плясовые][russiandance]  
Just a little something to spice up birthday parties. Russian dance music. And I don't mean modern dance music - I'm talking about traditional music here. Kazachok! (yeah, I know kazachok is originally ukrainian, but hey, what isn't?)
14. [Океан Эльзи - Избранное][okeanelzi]  
One more band with music completely unknown to me, but whose greatest hits I always wanted to have.
15. Carl-Johan Vallgren - [Livet][cjvlivet] and [Nattbok][cjvnattbok]  
I kinda like his music and his books. And these two albums were the only ones that I didn't have. And - guess what - now I have them.
16. [Вместе весело шагать][childrensoundtrack]  
Soundtracks from Soviet cartoons. Just like that. A little something to listen to with my children.
17. [Ногу Свело - Обратная Сторона Ноги][nogusvelo]  
Nogu Svelo's latest album. Nothing new, but quite interesting covers of their classic songs.
