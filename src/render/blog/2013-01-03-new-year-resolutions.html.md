All right, first days of the new year, best time to post my resolutions for the year. Last year one of my main resolutions was to learn to program in some more or less modern language. One that's useable out there in the big world. And I've learnt a bit of Java and a bit of Python. I have to say thank you to two sites for this: [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) and [edX](http://edx.org). I consider this resolution to be fulfilled. 

This year, in addition to continuing my neverending journey through programming (I'm planning on taking up Ruby and learning some advanced, popular Java topics such as Spring, Hibernate, etc), I have made other plans. My main goal for the year is learning an other language. The resolution may be a dull one, but it is very important to me. I have been dreaming of learning a couple of certain languages for a long time and, the same way I fulfilled my dream of taking up programming, I intend on fulfilling the other dreams. This year's language will be French.

All in all my list for the year looks like this:

- Learn French;
- On with programming:
	- Try Ruby;
	- Try Objective-C;
	- Study popular Java libraries;
	- Read more about algorithms;
- Don't forget other languages!
	- Read something in Swedish;
	- Continue my Swedish podcast, Utan;
- Read more!
- Try to drink white tee instead of coffee;
- Walk more *(get off a couple of stops early, stop using elevators)*;
- Go to bed earlier, at 22:00 at most;
- Post more;
- Take more interesting pictures;
- Learn to play the guitar better.

That's probably about it. If I come up with something else, I'll be sure to update this post.
