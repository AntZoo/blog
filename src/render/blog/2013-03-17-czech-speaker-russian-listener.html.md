Being Russian and using the Czech language is very exciting. As our languages were developing and parting ways, while still staying in the same families, they lost some words and invented others. Thus, when I as a Russian hear certain Czech words, they may sound very old-fashioned to me - they could have been used in the Russian language a long time ago and then abandoned (I know it's true the other way round too, some Russian words seem very XVI-century to the Czechs). For example, such normal Czech words as "dlaň" (palm of one's hand) or "oči" (eyes) make me feel like as if I'm living in a long forgotten poem about chivalrous knights and damsels in distress. And if I'm at the moment somewhere medieval, like the Gothic parts of Prague, it only adds to the experience.

The other part of the Russian speaking Czech experience is that some words sound a bit funny. Those are hard to explain, because I myself don't understand why they do sound this way. An example would be a word like "letadlo" (plane) and lots of other words that end with -dlo. A special subcategory here would be vowelless words: the infamous tongue twisters "Strč prst skrz krk" and "Vlk zhltl hrst zrn" make some of my compatriots giggle nervously and decide to never try and learn this language.

And finally the widespread category that is very common in every language learning process. Translators' false friends, as we call them in Russian. Lots and lots of them. "Čerstvý" meaning fresh in Czech and stale in Russian. "Sklep" - basement in Czech and crypt in Russian. There's literally hundreds of them. So, one should always be ready to find out that a new words one had just heard actually means something completely different from what one expects.
