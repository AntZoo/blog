description: Windows Phone predicts movie quote endings.
---

So, Randall from XKCD posted this comic about iOS keyboard predictions and tried going along with the predictions to finish some famous movie quotes. I thought I'd try and do the same with Windows Phone's prediction system. Here goes:

1. Elementary, my dear *friend*.

2. Say hello to my little *sister and her husband and wife of the most important thing*.

3. Toto, I've a feeling we're not *going to be the best way of life and death*. ðŸ’€

4. Bond. James Bond *with the same thing as the mayor*.

5. I'm a leaf on the wind. Watch *the game and the other hand*. âœ‹

6. Goonies never say *never and it is a good day*. ðŸ˜Š

7. -- You have my sword.  
-- And my bow.  
-- And my *mom*.

Also, the alt text:

8. Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You *can be used for any reason*.

9. Revenge is a dish best served *cold*. *(yep, it did suggest 'cold')*

10. They may take our lives, but they'll never take our *word for it*.
