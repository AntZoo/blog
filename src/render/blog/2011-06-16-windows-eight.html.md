What I like is that the UI looks fresh, smooth and snappy. I think this system will finally look great on a Tablet PC (or a slate, as MS tends to call it) - as long as the developers chime in and update their apps to meet the new standards. I think that Windows 8 can be a success. The only thing I do not get is this: do they really think this interface is comfortable to use on a conventional PC? With a mouse and keyboard? Really?

By the way, I also like the naming that started with Windows 7 and hope they will continue just incrementing the number with new versions coming out.
