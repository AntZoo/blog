I originally intended to post this to my Russian blog - and maybe I’ll do so in the close future. But for now I told myself, hey, there may be people out there interested in these podcasts who don’t speak Russian or don’t speak it fluently. And so I decided to put this list here. If you’re interested in an .opml file with these subscriptions, go ahead and ask in the comments. I’ll be happy to give you a link. Though the further away your request is from this post’s date, the higher the chances that it’ll look a bit differently. I tend to add new subscriptions and delete old ones, as my tastes/preferences change.

For your comfort I divided the list into tags and each category - into languages. To each ‘cast there’ll be a short comment to tell you what I like about it.

## TECH/RUSSIAN

### Радио-Т

This one’s a major podcast in Russia, a 1.5 - 2 hour show about technology. Weekly. Each first episode of the month is geeky and covers some weird topics.  
- FEED http://feeds.feedburner.com/Radio-t 
- HOME http://new.radio-t.com/search/label/podcast

### Пираты-РТ

That’s a podcast that is recorded after the Радио-Т. While the audio tracks are being encoded and uploaded to the host, the part takers talk about some unrelated stuff and/or some other tech stuff.  
- FEED http://feeds.feedburner.com/pirate-radio-t 
- HOME http://pirates.radio-t.com

### Монокли

This one I haven’t tried yet, it’s a new one for me. As far as I know, it’s a monologue type of podcast. About techie stuff.  
- FEED http://monocle.rpod.ru/rss_o6l_ae9c.xml 
- HOME http://monocle.rpod.ru

### Диджестив от Саши и Каши

That’s quite a popular podcast in Russia, from an (in)famous analyst Eldar Murtazin. Mostly about mobile phones and similar consumer electronics. I keep it in the feed for times when I want to hear his opinion on some particular event. He’s moving away from podfm at the moment, thus I don’t know how long will the links be functioning.  
- FEED http://m.digestive.podfm.ru/rss 
- HOME http://m.digestive.podfm.ru

### UTP - Технический Подкаст от Umputun

A rarely updated podcast about geeky and complicated technology stuff.  
- FEED http://feeds.feedburner.com/umputun/utp 
- HOME http://utp.umputun.com

### The Art Of Programming

New to the list. Has to be about programming. :)  
- FEED http://taop.rpod.ru/rss_o6l_ae9c.xml 
- HOME http://taop.rpod.ru

## TECH/ENGLISH

### this WEEK in TECH

Everybody knows TWiT from Leo and friends. I keep it in the feed to listen to when I’m bored. I don’t like it that much to listen to each episode.  
- FEED http://leoville.tv/podcasts/twit.xml 
- HOME http://thisWEEKinTECH.com

### MacBreak Weekly

New one. Don’t know if it’s good yet and don’t know if it’s going to stick around.  
- FEED http://feeds2.feedburner.com/larsentm_ttps 
-HOME http://mrnetcast.com/feeds

### Slashat.se

I tend to listen to this from time to time to support my Swedish mainly. The show is nice, but for me - not better than Радио-Т.  
- FEED http://feeds2.feedburner.com/slashat 
- HOME http://slashat.se

#### TECH/CZECH

### Fight Club

Okay, I haven’t listened to it yet. And strictly speaking it’s not about tech - it has to be a gaming podcast. I’ve subscribed out of desperation - there are hardly any podcasts in Czech out there.  
- FEED http://games.tiscali.cz/podcast/rss.xml 
- HOME http://games.tiscali.cz/podcast

#### JOURNALS/RUSSIAN

### Разговорчики

Yep, I’m subscribed to my own cast. Just to check it’s being updated okay.  
- FEED http://feeds.feedburner.com/WholeZoo 
- HOME http://podcast.zujev.eu

### Пять минут до поезда

No idea if this one’s good or not. It’s short and I liked the description, so I’ve subscribed. But I haven’t tried it yet.  
- FEED http://5min-train.rpod.ru/rss_o6l_ae9c.xml 
- HOME http://5min-train.rpod.ru

- FEED http://gwp.rpod.ru/rss_o6l_ae9c.xml

- HOME http://americhka.us 

### UWP - Eженедельный подкаст от Umputun

This one I don’t ever miss. One of my personal favourites. Again - a geek’s life in the US. He is also the host of Радио-Т.  
- FEED http://feeds.feedburner.com/Umputun 
- HOME http://podcast.umputun.com/search/label/podcast

### THE BIG PODCAST!

A cast from one of the forefathers of Russian podcasting. Dull and repetitive. But nice to listen to from time to time, as background noise.  
- FEED http://vasilysweekend.rpod.ru/rss.xml 
- HOME http://vasilysweekend.rpod.ru

### Radio Grinch

Another favourite that I don’t ever miss. A little bit about everyday life, a bit of politics, a tiny bit of gadgetry. A nice listen.  
- FEED http://radiogrinch.podfm.ru/rss 
- HOME http://radiogrinch.podfm.ru

#### STORIES/RUSSIAN

### Модель Для Сборки

Modern literature readings. Kinda like an audio book. I tend to listen to it when the story description interests me.  
- FEED http://mds.podfm.ru/rss/rss.xml 
- HOME http://mds.podfm.ru

Again, some storytelling in English. Haven’t tried it out yet.  
- FEED http://feeds.newyorker.com/services/rss/feeds/fiction_podcast.xml

- HOME http://sverigesradio.se/sida/default.aspx?programid=3706

#### MUSIC/RUSSIAN

- FEED http://aerostat.rpod.ru/rss_o6l_ae9c.xml 
- HOME http://aerostat.rpod.ru

#### MUSIC/ENGLISH

### Adam Curry’s Daily Source Code

Fell into this category, as there’s usually lots of music in this cast, so I listen to it only because of the music. It matches my tastes quite often.  
- FEED http://www.mevio.com/feeds/dailysourcecode.xml 
- HOME http://www.mevio.com/shows/?show=dailysourcecode

#### PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY/RUSSIAN

### Янки после пьянки

- HOME http://ypp.rpod.ru

### Как Жить: Советы Профессионалов

I don’t really know if this one’s good, haven’t tried it either. But I’m kinda into philosophy and applied psychology, so I tend to be interested in such stuff.

- HOME http://kak-zhit.podfm.ru

#### PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY/ENGLISH

### Psychology in Everyday Life: The Psych Files

This and the next cast I haven’t listened to for a year or so. I got bored and deleted them from my list. Now they’ve been given a second chance. People say they’re worth it. :)

- HOME http://www.philosophybites.com

#### PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY/SWEDISH

### Filosofiska rummet i P1

- FEED http://api.sr.se/api/rssfeed/rssfeed.aspx?poddfeed=3963 
- HOME http://sverigesradio.se/sida/default.aspx?programid=793

#### RANDOM/RUSSIAN

### Свежие подкасты на Rpod

- FEED http://feeds.feedburner.com/18plus-podcast 
- HOME http://18plus.rpod.ru

#### SEX/ENGLISH

### Sex Nerd Sandra

Haven’t tried it yet. But I’m in constant search for good sex podcasts. Discussion type and not your typical educational and sore that you can use to talk yourself to sleep. Something like 18плюс above. Haven’t found one yet, hope this one’ll turn out to be better.  
- FEED http://sexnerdsandra.libsyn.com/rss 
- HOME http://sexnerdsandra.libsyn.com

#### FOREIGN COUNTRIES/RUSSIAN

### “Японские Городовые”

- FEED http://gorodovye.rpod.ru/rss_o6l_ae9c.xml 
- HOME http://gorodovye.rpod.ru

### Молодежная Заграница

- FEED http://multipeople.podfm.ru/rss 
- HOME http://multipeople.podfm.ru

#### FOREGIN COUNTRIES/ENGLISH

### This American Life

A podcast about America. I tried one episode and got sickly bored in about 15 minutes of listening. I’ll give it another shot or two, seeing as it is quite popular on iTunes. But I don’t know if it will stick around.  
- FEED http://feeds.thisamericanlife.org/talpodcast 
- HOME http://www.thisamericanlife.org

#### LANGUAGES/ENGLISH

### A Way with Words

I had once lost this cast and didn’t remember any names, so I couldn’t find it. Now I have found it and will keep it in my list. It’s a cast about the English language. Quite interesting.  
- FEED http://feeds.waywordradio.org/awwwpodcast 
- HOME http://awww.libsyn.com

### Grammar Girl Quick and Dirty Tips for Better Writing

- FEED http://teacherluke.podOmatic.com/rss2.xml 
- HOME http://teacherluke.podomatic.com

### Språket i P1

A great podcast if you’re interested in Swedish. They talk about everything Swedish and answer the listeners’ questions. One of the hosts is a philologist which speaks for itself.

- HOME http://sverigesradio.se/sida/default.aspx?programid=411

- HOME http://www.howstuffworks.com

### Why You’re Wrong

As my dad’s a great skeptic, I’m kinda used to him doubting this and that. Now that I live quite far away from both of my parents, I want to try to use this cast as a substitute. :) Haven’t tried it yet though.

#### TALK RADIO/RUSSIAN

### Сиськи - Письки Шоу

They stopped updating the cast this spring, but I hope they come back. Full of foul language (and euphemisms), discussing random topics. But kinda fun and relaxed.

- HOME http://siski-piski-show.rpod.ru

### Охотник За Головами

- FEED http://dialogi.podfm.ru/rss 
- HOME http://dialogi.podfm.ru

### BBSeva from BBCRussian

Don’t know if this is a talk radio or not - haven’t tried it yet. But BBSeva is a legend from the Soviet times, a voice, that was telling us all about the Western life, thus helping avoid the brainwashing and propaganda - I hope he doesn’t disappoint me. :)  
- FEED http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/worldservice/bbseva/rss.xml 
- HOME http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/radio/radio_bbseva

#### TALK RADIO/ENGLISH

### No Agenda

- FEED http://www.mevio.com/feeds/noagenda.xml 
- HOME http://www.mevio.com/shows/?show=noagenda

### New Yorker: Out Loud

I am not even sure what this is about. :) But I guess they said in the description that it covers a wide range of topics that they write about in the New Yorker. I thought it could be cool and subscribed.

- HOME http://www.newyorker.com

Here you go. In a day or so the list may look different. But at the moment this is what I’ve got.
