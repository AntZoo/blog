Slowly, but surely, people begin to realize that there ain't gonna be a new iPad this spring. Come on, I've been saying this since the release of those new iPads last autumn - nobody is going to move to a half-year cycle, it's ridiculous. The only thing Apple did was move the iPad releases closer to Christmas to get more sales - which is absolutely natural and understandable. Now, I'm not claiming I know some insight or something, but I - myself - am one hundred percent sure that the new iPads will come out this autumn. And then the autumn after that. Mark my words.
