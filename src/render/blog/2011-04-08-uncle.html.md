I’m an uncle now!

And as for the less exciting news, I’ve been to the police to ask for the residence permit. Now I am waiting for their decision and probably for them to come and visit us to check whether our partnership is true. Plus I’ve been to a job interview. I don’t know if they are going to accept me, but I am pretty excited about the job opportunity.
