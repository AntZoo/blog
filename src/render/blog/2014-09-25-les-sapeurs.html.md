Yeah, I know, it's a Guinness ad. But it is amazing, I couldn't resist posting it. Les Sapeurs means The Dandys in English, or Щёголи in Russian. It is a movement in Congo, they dress in expensive suits as a way to say that they are masters of their own fates and it is up to them to decide what to do of themselves. Seeing photos with them among the typical Congo crowd is unusual to say the least. You don't typically expect well dressed men in such places, and yet there they are. Also, they remind me of стиляги - a Soviet youngsters movement who tried to copy the western style of life and dressed in colourful suits and clothes and listened to jazz. They tended to overdo it, but they can be excused - there wasn't that much freely available and truthful information on the West back then. We actually had a musical about стиляги in Russia, (in)appropriately translated as Hipsters into English. Here's a clip from it, enjoy, and take care:
