Here's an interesting story for you. Wolves, after being reintroduced to the Yellowstone National Park in the USA, changed its ecosystem completely, helping vegetation regenerate, other animals to multiply and rivers and ponds to form. This is called a trophic cascade and the Yellowstone story is just one of the examples of it.
