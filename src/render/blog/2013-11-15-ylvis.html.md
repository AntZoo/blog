So there's this band that isn't actually a real band (they are a Norwegian talk slash comedy show) that swept through the *Internetz* with their hit song **"What Does The Fox Say"**. Here it is, in case you haven't seen it before:

I just wanted you to see that they aren't only singing the Fox song. They've lots more up their sleeve:

  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=PaEnaoydUUo">Someone Like Me</a>
  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ua1FAlHt_Ys">The Cabin</a>
  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=JvUMV1N7eGM">Massachusetts</a>
  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Yn-oemgzlEU">Jan Egeland</a>
  <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=Y8i1Ddj1Sw8">Pressure</a>
</div>

They actually have a little more stuff, but that's the top videos from the search results on YouTube.
