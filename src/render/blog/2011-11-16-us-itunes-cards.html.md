For those of you who don’t know, I currently use a US iTunes Store account. I’d switch to the Czech Rep. Store anytime, but I don’t have a bank account here yet, let alone a credit card, so that’ll have to wait. Probably in a couple of years. Anyway, as I don’t have a US credit card either, I have no other choice, but to buy iTunes Gift Cards. I have searched for a nice online store with valid cards for some time, tried buying from different people and had a favourite seller, who, quite sadly, stopped the business some time ago, and finally I have found the best place of them all. I’ll recommend it to you - and if you buy cards via the link I’ll give you, I’ll get free stuff from him. I won’t hide the fact that it’s an affiliate link from you. So, here goes.

The store is called ZHLJerry and it is located [here](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=90091&c=ib&aff=187418). Try it - you won’t be disappointed. The prices are reasonable, the cards are being delivered in a flash, you’ll get the card scan before you can spell “cheeseburger”. It is really and truly great.
