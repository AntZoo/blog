There was a really nice article in [Bobuk's linkblog][add], called ["Hacking language learning"][hll]. The authour, a Slovak, in the neverending process of learning English, found quite a special way of reading books. Note though, that his idea is usable with any language, but it would probably be harder to implement for certain [synthetic languages][synth].

Anyway, the idea is that before reading a new chapter, he loads the book into his little program that then analyzes the words in the chosen chapter and gives him an overview with all those words, sorted by number of occurences in the whole book; and if he clicks a word - a definition from the OS X system dictionary and an image from Google Image Search. This way he learns the words before reading the chapter and can enjoy the book more, without having to look up the words while reading.

I'd say to him: **great idea, very nice!**
