I sold an old notebook yesterday. An IBM ThinkPad T20. For 1000 rubles (~ $30). A little, meaningless sum of money for a notebook. Though it was quite a bit old and had a dead battery (including the little Li-Ion battery which led to BIOS forgetting the date and asking for it during each boot process). 

Anyway, what I wanted to say. I’m glad I sold it. Especially glad because the person who bought it is intending to use it. I would really hate the situation where I’d have to just throw it away like some piece of junk. Now I feel it is in good hands.
