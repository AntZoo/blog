"New", *in quotes* because I am fairly sure they aren't that new. But I have only found them recently, so they're brand new for me. Enjoy (and if YouTube takes the vids down, sorry, but there's nothing I can do). I won't comment on them, as there's not much to say, but the music is great and the lyrics - OH, THE LYRICS! - are just perfect!

And a couple of videos I am not that crazy about, but that are fine and fun nonetheless.
