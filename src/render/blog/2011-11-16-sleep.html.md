When I was a lot younger I lived by that principle. I’ll sleep when I’m dead. Probably not that much by the first part of the phrase - I’ve never done that much “living while I’m alive” from that general point of view, although I’d really want to experience some of the living. I still want to go parachute jumping one day.

Anyway. The older I get (not that I’m old - not yet) the less I like that principle. I do continue to live by it, but now it’s mostly because I have no other choice. Work starts at 6 in the morning and even if it didn’t - once you have children, you don’t sleep much. Pete’s alive and kickin’ at 7 a.m. tops. So yeah, not much sleeping going on in my life.

But yeah, rock on! I’ll sleep when I’m dead. Even if - really - I’d sleep as if I’m dead.
