Here's an idea that hit me today. Well, not today. Not really. Okay, I have beeen thinking it since a long time ago - it occurred to me when I was studying in middle school. The idea is that we cannot do anything against our own will.

It's funny when you stop to think about it: our brain always makes the decision, we cannot act without our brain giving out limbs the signal to act. Even when we do something we don't want to do, we don't actually do it against our will. Well, figuratively speaking, yes. But really, when we have to do something we don't want to do, but must do, say, take out the trash, we actually choose to go and do it because we, for example, don't want to go to bed with the trash stinking up our kitchen. Do you get what I mean? It's still our choice to go and do what needs to be done.

It's a simple thought, but an interesting one. Puts everything in a perspective.
