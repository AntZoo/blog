Ok. I’ve tried writing about the movie in Czech, but apparently I’m still not proficient enough in the language to produce such texts.

I’ve been to the movies yesterday, here in Ostrava. I went to a movie theatre from the Cinestar multiplex chain to be exact. And I went there to see “Czech Made Man”, a new Czech movie.

The movie was great. It wasn’t as full of action as one could’ve hoped, but still a pretty nice movie to watch. It tells the story of a Czech boy, brought up in a bad family with an alcoholic stepfather who took his money and beat him when he was in a bad mood. After one of the beatings the boy decided to get rich. And the whole story afterwards is his story of reaching the ultimate richness, bringing him millions of dollars every day. To get that of money he uses all sorts of foul play, like selling Bohemian glass that was actually produced in China. In the end he finds out about cybersquatters and scam sites and builds an empire of sites, based on domain names with typos in them. Each site shows a number of banners and each click gets him a couple of cents. Well, you know the drill. Life gets rich, life gets good.

The question is, at what cost does such richness come?
