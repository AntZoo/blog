I had the most interesting dream tonight. In that dream M and I were in a house of some sort, where everybody was a zombie. And we had to kill every single one of them. She was, naturally, afraid and worried, and I couldn’t understand: they were all zombies, but of some strange reason they were speaking, acting and moving as living beings. We had no weapons, by the way - the zombies had to be killed with a thick folder that had a sharp hard cover. For a zombie to die one had to cut off its head. It wasn’t a quick task, with a folder, so it took us several minutes per zombie - during which the zombie calmly continued doing what it was doing before. For example, one of them was apparently an accoutant - it was filling out some report while I was sawing off its head.


In the early morning I had some other dream, but I can’t really remember what it was about.
