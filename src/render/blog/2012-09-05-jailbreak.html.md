All right, I am finally writing the long promised post about my jailbreak apps. Stuff I use every day. Have to say, I abandoned the iPad jailbreak, as it appears that the first gen iPad cannot really handle it that well. It was constantly running out of memory, force quitting apps on its own and rebooting now and then. Maybe I installed some bad tweak or two, I don't know, but I never really needed jb on the iPad, so away it went. I had a similar problem on the iPhone, but I uninstalled Paperlock and Dashboard X and everything went bak to normal.

Anyway, here's a list of the jailbreak tweaks and apps I use. The description of each of them is below the list.

And now for the descriptions:

#### Action Menu + Action Menu Plus Pack
##### Adds new functions to the cut-copy-paste menu and optionally replaces text with icons on the buttons.
I really like the icons-in-place-of-text idea, even though it slows down the menu a little bit (it appears with a slight delay) + the additional functions can be pretty useful. My personal favourite is clipboard history, but there's lots of other stuff, like tweeting the selected text, inserting current date/time, etc.

#### Activator
##### Lets you invoke certain functions with gestures.
It kinda installed itself with some other tweak and it is a package other stuff is quite often dependent on it being installed, so you'll most likely have it too. I used to use it a lot, it was one of the primary reasons of me doing the jailbreak, but now I replaced some of the Activator-based gestures with other tweaks. I have five(six?) left - one for invoking Deck (swipe to the left on the status bar), another one for stopping/playing music while locked (swipe down from the status bar), another two for switching to the next/previous track (volume up/down buttons), another for toggling Color Profiles on and off (double tap on the status bar) and the last one - to lock the icons (hold on the status bar).

#### AptBackup
##### Backs up your Cydia prefs and apps.
Never used it yet, but I'm planning to, as soon as the jailbreak for iOS 6 comes out. :)

#### ayecon + ayecon Clockify Theme
##### Gorgeous theme.
I had never really liked theming until I saw this. It makes your icons about 10% smaller (optionally) and 200% more detailed. Every stock icon and a great deal of third-party app icons are recreated to make full use of the retina display. Gorgeous, take my word for it. The only downside is that it functions through Winterboard and they say it is laggy. Personally I don't see it, but it can be a problem for some.

#### Barrel
##### Animations for screen swipes.
This tweak lets you choose an animation with which the screens are changed when you swipe through them. Useless, but nice nonetheless. My current favourite is Carousel.

#### Browser Changer
##### Lets you set alternative browsers as the default.
I love Google Chrome for iOS, so that's why I use the tweak.

#### CleverPin
##### Turns of PIN lock based on certain conditions.
I use it to un-PIN my iPhone when I am on my home or work network.

#### Clockify
##### Animates your clock app icon to show current time and gives you a nice widget with time in places, specified in the Clock.app.
I like it, although I don't really use it. :)

#### Color Profiles
##### Tweaks the color profile of the iPhone.
I just love the "Bold" color profile and cannot use my iPhone without it. Also, I noticed that my screen had a yellowish tint to it when compared with some of the other iPhones and this tweak fixed that.

#### Crash Reporter
##### Presents to you logs of application crashes and tries to identify the culprit.
This one has never really helped me, but I still hope that it will, some day. :)

#### CyDelete
##### Lets you delete Cydia apps the same way you delete normal apps.
I am not sure why I need it, but it doesn't hurt to have it installed.

#### DataDeposit
##### Saves your app data in your Dropbox.
I don't really trust iCloud, as not every developer has included the iCloud saving in their app. So, if I grow tired of a game, I save its state in the Dropbox and delete it to win some space. When I want to continue where I left, I just install it again and restore the Dropbox data.

#### Deck
##### Slides a tab with different switches and shortcuts off the side of the screen.
I just love it: I have the Settings.app handy, my Camera+ shortcut and all those plane mode, cellular data, etc. handy. I slide the Deck from the right side of my screen, by swiping over the status bar to the left.

#### DisplayCandy
##### Customizes your app opening/switching/closing animation.
You might have noticed that I love all those animation tweaks. This one is used in conjunction with Zephyr. When you exit an app with a Zephyr gesture, it slides away to the top. So, when I open an app, DisplayCandy Push'es it down from the top and the experience becomes consistent. I also love the Ripple effect while switching apps and the Suck effect when closing the app with my Home Button.

#### Gridlock
##### Lets you position the app icons freely, anywhere on the screen.
I use that to logically divide the apps into groups. For example, I might have a row of camera apps, then an empty row, then a row with two folders for photo editing apps and then a row with video editing apps. It's better than having all those icons all thrown together in a big messy pile of apps.

#### IconLock
##### Locks the icons, not letting you move them around or delete them.
I installed this tweak when the jailbreak really slowed down my iPhone (I had since identified the bad tweaks and uninstalled them). It was so laggy that when you wanted to launch an app, the Home Screen would sometimes enter the jiggly mode and you had to exit that mode and try to relaunch the app. IconLock let me forget about it, as I locked my icons as soon as they were in place. As a bonus, my son isn't able to delete the locked icons.

#### Infinifolders
##### Lets you put as many apps inside a folder, as you wish.
I rarely need this tweak, but sometimes I do. I don't like to have folders named "Games 1", "Games 2" and "Games 3".

#### Jukebox
##### Gives you a widget to put either in the Notification Center or on the Dashboard of Dashboard X. The widget then gives you music controls and displays the artwork of the currently playing track.
Mine is in the NC. And it has a switch in the settings that hides it when music apps aren't running.

#### LockScreenCustomizer
##### Tweaks the lock screen in a variety of ways.
I like my lock screen kept clean - that's why I have that Activator action set up, to play/pause music. There's nothing on my lock screen, except for the unlock slider (made twice as thin with ayecon) and the camera button. Apart from those there's only a beautiful wallpaper there.

#### ManualCorrect
##### Tweaks the autocorrect feature so that it still offers you the corrections, but you have to tap them to accept them.
I often write something in Czech or in transliterated Russian and the autocorrect there really bugs me. This tweak is a life saver.

#### NCSettings
##### Gives you a widget with settings toggles.
All switches that I might use and that can't be found in Deck reside here.

#### NetMeter + NetMeterWidget for NC
##### Keeps track of your traffic and shows you how much you have left.
My only complaint is that it only has monthly renewals (mine renews every third month) and that it only has days 1 to 28 to choose from as the first day of billing cycle. Apart from that it's pretty nifty.

#### Nitrous
##### Turns on the nitro js engine for third-party apps.
I have it switched on for Google Chrome, naturally.

#### OmniStat for Notification Center
##### Gives you all sorts of useful information about your device + lets you kill all apps and free RAM.
It was very useful while my iPhone was laggy as hell. Now I almost never look at it, but still have it, just in case.

#### OpenSSH
##### Opens up your device for SSH access.
I don't know why I have it, although it too can come in handy sometime. Make sure you change the root and mobile passwords though.

#### Parallax
##### Lets you install a widescreen wallpaper that scrolls with your screens.
Very nice feature. Useless, again, but pretty.

#### RandomRing
##### Cycles randomly through your ringtones giving you a random ring each time someone calls you.
I have so many ringtones that it gets hard to choose only one. This little tweaked made me a little bit happier.

#### Safari Upload Enabler
##### Enables you to upload stuff in Safari. Lets you choose files in your Camera Roll or in your Dropbox.
Saved my ass a couple of times. Will be almost useless (if it weren't for the Dropbox support) in iOS 6.

#### Sparrow Push + Sparrow+
##### Sets Sparrow as the default mail client and enables push notifications for it.
I don't like the fact that Sparrow is now owned by Google, but there isn't any other alternative. The default mail client sucks.

#### Springtomize 2 - iOS 5+
##### Has a rich arsenal of interface tweaks.
I use the tweak to hide all icon/folder labels, to expand the dock to six icons + shrink the icons a little bit so that they all fit in nicely. Plus there's other stuff, but I cannot live without the aforementioned tweaks.

#### StayOpened
##### Fixes the feature when the AppStore automatically closes when you buy or update an app.
Love it. Useless in iOS 6.

#### WiFi Passwords
##### Shows you the passwords of all WiFis that you were once connected to.
I am not sure I need it, with 1Password and all...

#### WiFiFoFum
##### A WiFi diagnostics/search tool and more.
Kinda the same as with the previous one.

#### Zephyr
##### Gives you multitasking gestures on the iPhone.
Very cool and nicely made too, definitely check this one out. Slide from the left, switch to the app to the left. Slide to the right, switch to the app to the right. Slide from the top and the screen slides away to reveal the Notification Center underneath it. Slide from the bottom and the current app gets pushed away from the screen. Slide from the bottom and hold for a couple of seconds to reveal the App Switcher. Functions smoothly, a lot better than when I tried replacing some of the gestures with simple Activator actions.

#### Zeppelin
##### Replaces the carrier logo with a custom logo.
There's literally hundreds of logo packs out there in Cydia, but I am happy with a default one. I have replaced my default VF (for Vodafone) with an Apple logo.
