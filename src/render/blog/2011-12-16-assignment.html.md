Got a new job assignment. Oh, goodie!

After all these articles/books/videos/movies on Jobs I’ve been consuming lately I’ve become a bit obsessed with beautiful code. I don’t want to simply write something that works - I want to write something that works and looks great.

Received an example of a program - something similar, that had been written in 2007. Thought I’d see lines and lines and lines of code and that I’d be terrified because I’d have to write something comparable by size and the deadline is already near. Turned out to be some 50-60 lines that can be written in a jiffy if carefully plan the logic ahead of coding. Which is what one should do anyway.

So, ok. Off to work. Wish me luck.
