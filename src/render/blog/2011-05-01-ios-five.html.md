There’s a feature in iOS 5 that not a lot of people will know about or even care about. This feature is a huge help for me and it has to do with language switching. In iOS 5 when you have 3+ international keyboards, the globe key cycles between the two last used languages. If you want to switch to a specific one, you have to press and hold on the globe. Finally! I have 5 keyboards - Russian, English, Czech, Swedish and Emoji. I don’t use the latter three that often. Now it’s a lot easier for me to switch between Russian and English only.
