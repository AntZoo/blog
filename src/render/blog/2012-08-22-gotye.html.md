Most people hadn't heard about Gotye until "Somebody That I Used to Know" began playing on the radio. I'm one of those guys. When I heard the hit song I decided to find out more and found that the guy is a musical genius. :) Here's an other clip that I like, from the same album as "Somebody <..>". Enjoy!
