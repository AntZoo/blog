description: After living with the iPhone 4 for many years I am planning to make a switch to Lumia 920.

So, those listening to my podcast, "Зоопарк", may be wondering why there hasn't been an update to it lately. Well, I'll tell you why. My iPhone is in service. I was planning to record on iPad, but it didn't feel right, so I just postponed the new episode till when I get back my phone.

But yeah, my iPhone's in service, again, as you could suspect it to be after reading my previous post on the state of affairs with Apple devices in our family. And this time the stuff that's happening to the phone was the last straw. I've been an Apple-preacher for the past, I don't know, 4 years, but I've grown tired of the problems lately and am seriously considering switching. Let me explain what *exactly* led me to this decision, what and how I am going to switch to and how I am going to do that.

Basically, the two main problems are that a) my iPhone has been in service more times than I could possibly tolerate, and b) new iPhones cost a hell of a lot and older models get fewer and fewer features of the newer iOS releases.

The repairs problem is simple. I've been once sold on Apple's devices' reliability, but my iPhone has been to the service 4 times and each time (except once) they replaced the phone with a new one. I had problems with the home button, the power button, the speakers, the headphones input, mobile network connectivity and the volume down button. I think that's it, but that's a pretty impressive list for a phone that I had for three years and that's supposed to be very reliable.

Now, that other thing. Sure, all top smartphones cost a lot. But while I can buy an iPhone 4s for a reduced price, it will lack most of the features that the iPhone 5s sports with the latest and greatest iOS 7 and with the next OS it will most likely get slow as shit and will make you want to throw it against the wall instead of using it. On the other hand, there's a certain Lumia 920 which still gets all the updates. Sure, I know, it was released with Windows Phone 8 and it still runs Windows Phone 8. But hey, 3 major updates from MS and 2 from Nokia all got through to the 920, not one of them was crippled in any way and all the new stuff runs on the 920.

Which brings me to another point. The Windows Phone OS is very smooth - from what I've seen and heard. I've yet to try it out, but it does make sense. The UI is so simple and minimalistic, I can't imagine *how* it would be able to slow the phone down, especially when the 920 has a gig of RAM and a 1,5 GHz dual-core CPU. Hell, it runs smoothly on weaker devices. Now, you can say that yeah, speed is nice to have and all, but what about the apps? To tell you the truth, I *am* a bit worried about the apps. But come to think of it, I only used about 10% of the apps installed on my iPhone anyway. And even if my phone usage became more app-centric, they *are* coming. The store is full of games and utilities, most of which are beautifully designed. You almost can't believe it's not an Apple device, actually. :) And sure, yeah, many of those games are outdated for an iPhone user. But who cares? When I play, I play for fun and to kill time, not to try the latest and greatest titles. *And* my favourite title, Jetpack Joyride, is there. I'm only going to miss 100 rogues, but that could get replaced by Metrogue (or some other funny metro-ish name, I don't really remember).

And on top of all that OS+Apps subject, there's also the camera. Two things. One: optical image stabilization. Two: manual controls. The only thng you can't control is the aperture, but you can't have it all in a smartphone camera, can you? Plus, there's a plethora of great camera apps/lenses in the Store - third party, Nokia or Microsoft Research, you name it.

You might ask why I'm not considering Android. Yeah, I get that question asked by a lot of people. My answer is simple: I believe in closed environments. Open enough so that I can more or less painlessly use a Lumia with my MacBook, but closed enough to not have to fiddle with the file system and with tweaking the phone OS so that I can use it to the fullest. Let the OS developers do that for me and I'll be more than happy. Again, looking at what Microsoft'd done with Windows Phone I'm constantly surprised I'm not looking at an Apple product. I would love to see these two platforms compete with each other and Android - to be left as an alternative to restless geeks who like their phone OS's open. Or *"open"*.

I'll keep you guys updated on how my switching goes. At the moment I'm still waiting for the iPhone to return from the repairs and then I'll go on to step one of the switching process: selling the iPhone.
