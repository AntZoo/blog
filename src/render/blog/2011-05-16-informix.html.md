Informix-4GL. Still not sure what to write about it. I guess, my article series is kinda DOA. :)

Anyway, to at least tell you something. I am not a programmer, as you will surely see from what I will be telling next.

The syntax is quite simple, english-like, one doesn’t need to end lines with special symbols. And SQL comes as part of the language. You can use the usual queries in the code without any special conversions. All the known stuff, as in “SELECT * FROM table”, “INSERT INTO table (blah-blah-blah) WHERE something=something”, “DROP TABLE table” and so on.

The interface of the end product is hard coded, as all the user gets is a terminal window. No mouse. Only keyboard.

I am still getting used to it. At the moment I have a calculator program that I am constantly improving, adding features to it and so forth. Yesterday I added history recording. Today I am adding the possibility to review that recorded history.
