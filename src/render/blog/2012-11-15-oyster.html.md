One moderately famous Russian blogger, Petr Didenko, published a [post](http://www.kip.ru/realtime/2012/11/oyster.html) on unified transport systems in his blog. This lead me to think that the world is getting filled with "fun" and "unusual" names which, considering the fact that there's lots of them already, don't look that fun and unusual anymore.
