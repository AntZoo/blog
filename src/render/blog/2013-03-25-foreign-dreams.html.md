Yesterday I dreamt a dream. It's not *that* unusual, I do dream from time to time. But this time it was a little special. I dreamt in Czech. That's my first dream in a foreign language. Sadly, I don't remember much, but I do remember that I dreamt of work and there were some of my colleagues who were talking to each other, in Czech.
