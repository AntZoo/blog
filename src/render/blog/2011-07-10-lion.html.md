They say in Russia that Lion is gonna be released this week. “Most likely”, this Wednesday. I can believe this week, but I’m not buying the Wednesday. When it gets released, it gets released on Friday here, Thursday - in America. Why? Because on Thursdays they update the pages of Featured, What’s Hot, New and Noteworthy apps. I’m pretty sure they’ll want Lion on one of the lists and won’t want to reschedule the store pages updates.
