It’s a funny chart, really. There are some pretty obvious advantages that Fire can boast - like it’s weight, for example. Or cost. But some of the other specs really make me smile. Look at them:

- “free cloud storage for iTunes content excluding movies” is really nice, except that movies are stored exactly the same way music is, if I haven’t been living in a parallel universe for the past few months. You buy it, it’s stored in your account, you redownload it when needed. Be it audio or video. No streaming for either of them, “storage” for both.  
- “Up to 7.5 hours of video playback, with wireless off” - this one is a spec of the Fire. Okaaay. Why are they comparing video playback with wireless off with mixed use on the iPad? Let’s go a bit deeper and compare reading a book with brightness dimmed down to a minimum and all networking disabled to “mixed use”. Then, maybe, just maybe, they’d make it over the iPad 10 hours. That was the one that really made me laugh.

Okay, that wasn’t a large list. But still, hilarious.
