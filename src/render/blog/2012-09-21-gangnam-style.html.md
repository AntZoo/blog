This post is for all you out there wondering what the hell the name of that song means. Turns out (<a href="http://www.curatorscode.org" target="_blank" style="font-family:sans-serif;text-decoration:none;" >&#x21ac;</a>[Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/)) that it is a Korean neologism that was coined to name the lifestyle of the Gangnam district in Seoul. It is apparently quite a rich part of the city, so you can imagine *that* lifestyle. A quote:
{% blockquote gogocj2012, http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gangnam%20Style&defid=6714999 %}
"Gangnam" means "south(nam) of the river(gang)" in Korean. In this song, the "river(gang)" is the Han River, which penetrates the City of Seoul, capital of South Korea. The northern part of Seoul(gangbuk) has been the capital of Korea since the early 15th century. Development of Gangnam and expansion of Seoul started in 1970s. Gangnam is the icon of the rapid economic development of South Korea in 1970s and 80s. Mostly benefited from skyrocketing real estate price followed by planned economic development, Gangnam has become the most wealthy area in the entire South Korea.  "Gangnam" is being regarded as the place where people are rich, girls are pretty and everything is supposed to be cool.
