With this post I am opening a series of posts on Informix-4GL, a language from the 80’s, developed by Informix,bought by IBM in 2001. I’ll be working with it from now on and will be using my blogs to summarise my knowledge of the language and keep it in order.

At the moment I know that it is a 4th generation object-oriented language with embedded SQL. In the following few days, as I am waiting for my residence permit, I’m going to read more about it and try to write code in it. I’ll report my progress to you.
