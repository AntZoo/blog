Funny how music can change one’s mood. One moment you go and think about how little time you’ve left till the next bus and how you cannot afford to miss it, about stuff that bothers you at work, at home and whatnot. The next moment you put on your headphones, plug the jack into your iPod or whatever, press play and the journey begins:

### Sting - “Englishman in New York”

The world plunges into the depths of this light-hearted, sorrowful, but nevertheless happy state, making you straighten up, smile and, with you chin up, just walk straight ahead at a steady pace. Your mind wanders, rising above the square you are currently crossing, above the city you’re in, being everywhere and nowhere at the same time, you fill your lungs with whatever it is this city calls air and you feel a certain calmness in every step, every breath. You look at other people and start noticing small traits you would’ve never noticed otherwise, a subtle smile here, an empty stare of a wandering mind there. Beautiful. And then…

### Gyllene tider - "Sommartider"

This Swedish summer classic lightens up the cloudy day, you still have a smile on your face, but the smile has changed. It isn’t the same moody smile you had but a moment ago, instead it is a happy, optimistic smile of a person who loves the city around him, the nature, everything. You look at the grass and see little flowers starting to bloom, look at the people around you and see their clothes being so light and airy, spinning around in the wind and inviting spring to join them in their windy dance. It feels almost like a ritual dance - crazy and unstoppable, calling upon the wind and the nature to dance along.

### Led Zeppelin - "Stairway to heaven"

And again - a thoughtful mood. Everything around slows down and begins to flow. Carefully, smoothly and quietly. As if the available time doubles up for you and you see everything as if you were playing the Max Payne shooter with its famous bullet-time. Then, with the words of the song, everything just blows up with life, the air spins round, rising higher and higher, the road ahead of your bus rips itself from the Earth and forms an unstable and steep, but welcoming hill leading upwards, towards the sun. And you follow, immersed in the sun’s blinding light.
