It was truly a great time. I was a student and had this idea of living in a world completely free of decisions and limits. The older you get the more it changes - your decisions add up, introducing new possibilities and shutting you off from other ones. You set your own new limits and modify old ones. You also limit yourself in one way to adjust other limits. And slowly, but surely, you find your expectations of life twisted in some way that you didn't expect, they have changed - for good or for worse, it is for you to decide. But they have most certainly not stayed the same. It can be refreshingly good to look back at the life you have lived, to ponder on what you had wanted to do with your life and where you ended up being, but be ready to be struck by the fact that those expectations will have nothing to do with the life you are living.
