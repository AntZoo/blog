This is a warning post. Don't repeat my mistake.  
*Although, if you do, it's not that bad.*

As many of you know, we have recently bought a new MacBook Air. A beautiful piece of technology. Slim, fast, quiet. But, I started setting it up right after Christmas and finished that same day late in the night. That way errors and mistakes were guaranteed.

First mistake. When setting up the main user account, I put in the wrong iCloud credentials. I have two iCloud accounts. Historical reasons. One of them is used for syncing, the other one - for buying. And instead of using the former for the user account I used the latter. Nothing special, but turns out (probably because of the second mistake) it was a big deal.

Second mistake. While fiddling with apps and system prefs in the evening, I said to myself, hey, we need a way of accessing each other's folders (we have two user accounts at home). Previously I solved this problem by placing the home dirs on a separate partition and ignoring the permissions on that particular partition. But that led to chaos and uneffective use of space of which I now only have 128 GBs. Now I just went and applied Read&Write permissions to both our home folders and clicked on the "Apply to enclosed items" thingie. Everything was fine and okay, except that the home folders contain important directories, such as, e.g. Library, and I now think that by changing those permissions on those directories and files within I have messed up the accounts.

Now, those were my mistakes. What were the problems I received because of them?

Firstly. My wife's account kept resetting the Finder and Dock settings. Every time I logged her out and in again, the Dock was back to its natural state - with all the stock icons, with auto-hiding and magnification turned off -, Finder was opened right from the start and it's sidebar had Medium sized font instead of a Small sized one, plus some other settings were lost. I tried everything I could think of/find on the Internet. Repairing permissions, checking login items, deleting all relevant plists, you name it. Nothing helped. So I ended up recreating the account and transferring all the stuff in the broken old one to the now functioning new one. That solved the problem and I have already deleted the old home dir.

Secondly. Day One app stopped working. It didn't open any window and the icon just sat there in the Dock saying it was unresponsive. No idea why Day One and not something else. I tried contacting their support, as I thought the problem was with the app, not the user account. The support was mildly helpful, but they'd probably help me reach the same conclusion I reached myself, albeit somewhat later.

Thirdly. My iCloud accounts were a mess. No matter what I tried, I couldn't switch the primary and secondary accounts. The best thing that worked was to delete the secondary account, sign out of the primary one, then sign in with the secondary (that has to become primary) and then add the primary (that has to become secondary). That worked - until the first reboot, when everything reverted to the previous state, with my secondary account being my primary. Again, nothing helped, not changing permissions, not anything else. What could I do? Well, again, I recreated the user and moved all the data over.

So, here you are. Don't make these mistakes. If you don't have data yet, just delete the home folder and it'll be recreated with all necessary permissions set up when you log in.

And don't try to set up your computer when you can't think straight.
