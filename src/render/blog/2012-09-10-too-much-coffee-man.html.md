Why do I write, now and then, that I need coffee if I insist on it having no effect on me? I guess the effect is there, but it is merely psychological. I got used to drinking coffee somewhere around the summer of the year 2006. It was then that I went to Sweden for the first time in my life - I stayed in a place called Birka, in Jâ€°mtland. Me and a bunch of other foreigners were studying Swedish language there, along with Swedish culture and traditions. Part of that culture is coffee-drinking, or fika, as the swedes call it (the name is said to be a child-like play on words and their syllables, it is a transformed "ka-ffe" - the syllables have switched places and the "ffe" became "fi"). Fika means drinking a cup of coffee with some dessert while chatting with your friends. As it plays quite a large role in the life of ordinary Swedes, we had a coffee machine with free unlimited coffee in our dining room which was opened all the time. And most of the day we spent communicating in Swedish while drinking liters of coffee. That's where my addiction comes from. And what is your story?

PS For those who are wondering about the meaning of the title of this post, here's a hint: [Too Much Coffee Man](http://www.tmcm.com/tmcm/).
