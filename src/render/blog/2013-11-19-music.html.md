description: The latest and greatest from my iTunes shopping spree.
---

I've just subscribed to a blog by [Dmitry Khraponov](http://snupt.com) and read his latest post. Became quite inspired and now I think I'll do this regularly: a list of stuff I bought on iTunes and liked. Here goes. There'll be a couple of old things as well, because this is the first post in the series. Also, there isn't any specific order to the list.

1. [ABBA - På svenska][abba]  
It's a rare album in it's physical form - I remember trying to find it some 4-5 years ago, and it proved virtually impossible. It's ABBA alright, but singing in their original language, Swedish. Curiosly enough, of all Swedes whom I asked, almost nobody knew they even sang in Swedish, let alone released such an album.
2. [Hugh Laurie - Didn't It Rain][hugh]  
Didn't impress me as much as his [first album](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/album/let-them-talk-special-edition/id476054239?l=en), but a nice listen nevertheless. Then again, maybe I need to listen more closely. After all, this isn't your usual background music.
3. [Tata bojs - Futuretro Max][tata]  
Very futuristic, almost too much for my taste. But the only album of Tata Bojs that I had was the "Kluci jde ste?" and I wanted another taste of their music. Next album I buy will most likely be the ["Hity a City"](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/album/hity-a-city/id660277447?l=en) which is essentially a collection of their hits. Which is fine by me.
4. [Genesis - The Platinum Collection][genesis]  
I have long ago wanted to learn more about the bands which I know by only a couple of their songs. Genesis is one of such bands. Recently I would only name "Jesus He Knows Me" and "I Can't Dance" if I had to remember any song by Genesis. Now I at least know that they also sing "Invisible Touch".
5. [Kryštof - Inzerat][krystof]  
Kryštof's latest and greatest. A really nice sounding album, I adore almost every song on the list. Nothing to add.
6. [Le pied de la pompe - Ici ou là][pied]  
A nice band I discovered while looking for French singers to help me learn French. Helped me get through the spring months.
7. [Movits! - Äppelknyckarjazz][movits]  
A rare exception to the rule that I don't like hip hop. This is one hip hop band from Sweden that proves otherwise. I coudln't stop listening to this album over and over again for a week.
8. [Paul McCartney - Kisses On the Bottom][paul]  
I've never really listened to sir Paul outside of the Beatles and now I think that has been a mistake that should get corrected. That's the second album I bought and I like it dearly. It's very jazzy and smooth. Relaxing. Very different when compared to the latest ["New"](https://itunes.apple.com/ru/album/new-deluxe-edition/id695034665?l=en) which still sits on my Wish List while I'm considering whether I like it enough to buy it. (And with each passing day I grow more and more on it.)
9. [The Puppini Sisters - The Rise And Fall Of Ruby Woo][sisters]  
I love this album. Very - what is it - cabaret-like? I can't really name the genre, so go on and listen to it yourselves and see if you like it. I do.
10. [Seasick Steve - Walkin' Man - The Best of Seasick Steve][steve]  
Blues. Nothing else to add, really. Didn't have the opportunity to explore the album more, but loved the sound and bought it. Now it's catching dust in my music library, waiting for me to wake up in the right mood to listen to it.
11. [Tom Waits - Bad As Me][waits]  
Wow. I was never into Tom Waits, but this album changed everything. And it took a podcast by BG to convince me to try it out. Very good, must listen.
12. [Uriah Heep - Into the Wild][heep]  
Nice album, glad to hear that Uriah Heep still rocks pretty much solidly.
13. [Nationalteatern - MNW Klassiker - Nationalteatern][teater]  
*A* Swedish rock band. An oldie. I don't really remember where I'd found out about it, but I like it. Very 60's like music.
