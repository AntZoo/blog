> Ah, ah,  
> We come from the land of the ice and snow,  
> From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.  
> Hammer of the gods will drive our ships to new land,  
> To fight the horde, sing and cry: Valhalla, I am coming! 
> On we sweep with threshing oar, Our only goal will be the western shore.

> We come from the land of the ice and snow,  
> From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.  
> How soft your fields so green, can whisper tales of gore,  
> Of how we calmed the tides of war. We are young overlords.

> So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,  
> For peace and trust can win the day despite of all your losing.
