You know what I hate when I book a table? Prepayment. Just yesterday I was booking a table at a restaurant in Poruba where we should have had an English Coffee Ostrava event today. And guess what - it was the first time here in Ostrava, that a venue wanted a prepayment. I won't give you the name of the place, but I most certainly won't be returning there myself and won't recommend it to anyone. And here's why.

The explanation is simple. I'm not a very busy man, but I, too, have stuff to do and free time to spend on things I want to do. I work, usually, from 5:30 to 15:30 (if you count the time I spend on the road) and when I return home, I usually use the time I have left to play with my son. In the evenings I generally either read something or study some IT topics. That's generally my usual daily schedule. During weekends I almost never sit on my backside, wondering what I should do next. I usually have some kind of a plan for the weekend.

Now, I, as a client of the bar/restaurant in question, know that the following day I will go there with a group of my friends and each of them will spend, say, 200 Czech crowns on beer. I know that, say, 6 will definitely come. I know that the only guarantee of those two facts - if I'm booking a table over the phone - is my own promise, nothing more. But tell me, why does the venue think that they have the right to make me go there personally and pay up front for them to book a table for me? I mean, I'm going there next day to spend money on their beer. Why should I spend my time now to make them believe me that I will come. To me is sounds pretty fucked up. And I do understand that they want to be sure they aren't losing the table. But that shouldn't be my problem. And they most likely won't lose the table anyway. Okay, they will probably tell the guys who come ten minutes to 18 (if I'm booking for 18) that the table is booked. But if I'm not there at 18:15 they have all the rights to call me and ask whether I'm coming or not. And, being a good client, as soon as I know that I'm not coming, I'm gonna call them and cancel the booking anyway.

So, I think I'll start a black/whitelist of Ostrava's venues and I know who will be on the first line of my personal blacklist.
