This morning I have greeted an old lady, passing by me when I was leaving home, with a “Доброе утро”, instead of “Dobré rano” which I should have said in Czech. The lady answered with a smile and a nod of the head. Although, I think she didn’t really hear me and was answering to a generic, non-Russian and non-Czech “Good morning”. People here are quite friendly. Friendly enough. A lot more friendly than back home in Russia.
